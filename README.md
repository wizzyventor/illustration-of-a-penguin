The Use of Css to Create and Animate a Penguin.
Penguin Animation and Landscape CSS Project
Project Overview
This project showcases a fun and interactive CSS-designed penguin character against a visually appealing animated landscape. It uses pure CSS to create a responsive and animated scene, including:

A penguin character with detailed facial features and body parts.
Animated arms (wave effect).
A background landscape with a sun, mountains, and a ground layer.
Visual enhancements through gradients, positioning, and transitions.
Key Features
Custom Properties (:root)
Variables are defined at the root level to allow for easy customization of penguin colors:

css
Copy code
:root {
    --penguin-face: white;
    --penguin-picorna: orange;
    --penguin-skin: gray;
}
You can quickly change the penguin's colors (face, beak, and body) by updating these variables.

Interactive Penguin

The penguin scales up when clicked (transform: scale(1.5)), providing an interactive feel.
Cursor changes to not-allowed during scaling for added feedback.
Animation (Wave Effect)
The penguin's left arm waves continuously using CSS keyframes:

css
Copy code
@keyframes wave {
    10%, 30% { transform: rotate(110deg) scaleX(-1); }
    20%, 40% { transform: rotate(130deg) scaleX(-1); }
}
Visual Gradients and Background

The background uses a diagonal gradient (45deg) to mimic a clear sky.
Mountains and ground are styled with linear gradients for depth and realism.
The sun is a simple yellow circle (border-radius: 50%) positioned in the top corner.
Modular CSS Classes
Each part of the penguin is represented with its own class, making the code clean and modular:

.penguin-head, .face, .eye, .beak, .arm, .foot, etc.
The body, head, and other elements use relative positioning (position: absolute) to fit together seamlessly.
File Structure
Here‚Äôs the breakdown of the code structure:

sql
Copy code
root/
‚îÇ-- index.html     (HTML structure to hold the penguin and scene)
‚îÇ-- styles.css     (This CSS file contains all the styles and animations)
How to Use
Copy the provided CSS code into a file named styles.css.
Create an HTML file (index.html) and link the CSS file using:
html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Add a container for the penguin and landscape in your HTML:
html
Copy code
<div class="sun"></div>
<div class="back-mountain"></div>
<div class="left-mountain"></div>
<div class="penguin">
    <!-- Add inner elements for penguin (head, face, eyes, etc.) -->
</div>
<div class="ground"></div>
Customization Options
You can easily customize the following:

Colors: Modify --penguin-face, --penguin-picorna, and --penguin-skin in the :root selector.
Animation: Adjust the duration and keyframes of the wave animation.
Positioning: Change values like margin-top, left, and top for precise placement.
Browser Support
This project uses standard CSS properties and works on modern browsers like:

Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Microsoft Edge
Safari
Future Enhancements
Consider adding the following:

Hover effects: Add subtle hover animations for interactivity.
Responsive design: Make the scene adaptable to smaller screens using media queries.
JavaScript interactivity: Add click events to toggle animations or change penguin expressions.
